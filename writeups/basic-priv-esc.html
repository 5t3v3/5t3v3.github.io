    <h1>Basic Privilege Escalation</h1>
    What does "privilege escalation" mean?

At it's core, Privilege Escalation usually involves going from a lower permission to a higher permission. More technically, it's the exploitation of a vulnerability, design flaw or configuration oversight in an operating system or application to gain unauthorized access to resources that are usually restricted from the users.

Privilege Escalation can be divided into two categories. Horizontal and Vertical Privilege Escalations
<br><br>
<b>Horizontal Privilege Escalation: </b> It is the method by which an attacker is able to access/hijack different user with the same privilege as the attacker.       
In this attack the attacker gets access to the user data and files owned by the victim user.
</p>
<br>
<b>Vertical Privilege Escalation: </b>In this method an  attacker escalates their privilege from a normal user to a higher authority user. Usually this higher authority user will be administrator or root.
After an successful privilege escalation to the root user , the attacker has full control over the system and has access to files that are restricted to normal users. 

<br><br>
Here I will be explaining basic techiniques for Privllege escalation in <strong>Linux :)</strong> 
<br><br>
<h3><U>Enumeration and Exploitation</u></h3><br>
The first step will obviously be enumerating the target. After gaining a user level access in a shell we must look where the vulnerability lies , sothat we could exploit that and gain root access.
The first command to check for that will be: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;$ sudo -l <br>
Sometimes there would be password authentication to check whether the current user can run the command. If the user is in the sudoers list, then this will list all the 
binaries that can be run by the current user with sudo privileges.<br>
After finding the binary which the user can run as sudo, the best way to find an exploit is through <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/" >GTFOBins.</a> 
Search for the binary in GTFOBins and you will get the right scripts for escalating the privileges.

<br><br><h4><u>LinEnum</u></h4><br>
LinEnum.sh is a bash script that will help us automating the process of enumeration. You can simply clone the github repo <a href="https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum">LinEnum</a> on to your local machine, and upload the script 
using a SimpleHTTPServer or if you have write access , then simply copy and paste the script in the victim machine . Then give the script executable permission ( chmod +x LinEnum.sh ).
Now just simply run the bash script (./LinEnum.sh) <br>This will give a massive output containing  :Kernel Information, Read/ Writable files, SUID files, Crontab contents and many more.
The only hard part is to analyse the output as it is little bit overwhelming.
<br><br>
<h4><u>Analysing the LinEnum results</u></h4>
<ul><li>The first thing to look for is Kernel versions. Look for available exploits on the kernel version in exploitdb or just google the version.
( Google is your best friend ). If you find the right exploit ,then fire it up..
</li>
<li>
The next thing we can see is the User/Group details . Previously logged in users can be found and this will help for horizontal privilege escalations.
The contents of /etc/passwd file will also help in enumerating possible users. 
</li>
<li>
Cron tabs are the next thing to look for. The crontab is a list of commands that you want to run on a regular schedule, and also the name of the command used to manage that list. Crontab stands for “cron table, ”
because it uses the job scheduler cron to execute tasks. In this we can find binaries that run with root privileges and sometimes we can edit the content to get root access.
</li>
<li>
Then we have the read/write sensitive files and the SUID files.
If we have read/write permissions to files like /etc/passwd ,/etc/shadow then we can exploit that to gain root access. 
<br>SUID files are programs that are allowed to be executed with the permissions of a specific user,
usually a user with higher privileges. When specific programs are set like this they can be abused to gain root access.

</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h4><u>Exploiting Writable /etc/passwd</u></h4><br>
The /etc/passwd file stores essential information, which  is required during login. In other words, it stores user account information.
The /etc/passwd is a plain text file. It contains a list of the system’s accounts,
giving for each account some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, and more.
It is not used to save the password anymore. 
From the LinEnum result we can find whether the /etc/passwd file is writable or not.
If this is writable, then we can abuse this to add a new user with root privileges.  <br><br>

The /etc/passwd file contains one entry per line for each user (user account) of the system. All fields are separated by a colon : symbol. Total of seven fields as follows<br>
<br>
<bold>test:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash</bold>
<br><br>
username: password: UID: GID: user id info: home dir: shell 
<br>
<ul>
<li>username : The username of the user<br>
</li>
<li>
password : usually 'x' is used in this field to show that its encryted and saved in /etc/shadow file <br>
</li>
<li>UID : User id, 0 is reserved for root,  1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts.
Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups<br>
</li>
<li>GID : Group id , usually stored in /etc/group</li>
<li>
User ID Info : Generally a comment to add extra info about a user
</li>
<li>
Home : It represents the absolute path of the directory where the user will be when they login.
</li>
<li>
Shell : The absolute path of a shell or command. (/bin/bash ,/bin/sh ...)
</li>
</ul>
<br>

So how to exploit this is the question now?
It's a simple process, if we have write access to /etc/passwd, we will create a new user with root privileges.
<br><br>

But first we have to create a password hash in the standard form( hashed ), for that we use openssl.
The command for that is : <br><br>
<b>openssl passwd -1 -salt [salt] [password]</b>
<br>
Here is an example for that : <br>openssl passwd -1 -salt new 123
<br>The output will be:<br>
$1$new$p7ptkEKU1HnaHpRtzNizS1 <br><br>
$1 represents MD5 hash<br>
$new is the salt I used  <br>
The rest is the hashed password<br><br>
Add this to the /etc/passwd file in the right format. <br>

Now just su into the new user with the password and you will be root user.
<br><br>
Privilege escalation is a vast topic and can't be explained in a single writeup. 
These are some techniques I use in CTFs .   <br><br>
Thanks for the read :)
