    <h1>NMAP</h1>
    <p><h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>Nmap or network Mapper is an open source tool utility for network discovery and security auditing.
        Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of literally hundreds of thousands of machines.
        Nmap is usually the place we start active reconnaisance or information gathering on a target.
        <br><br>
        <h3><u>Nmap Usage</u></h3>
        Like most pentesting tools, nmap is run from the terminal.
        There is a GUI version of nmap called Zenmap, which has the same functionality and more user friendly.
        There are versions available for both Windows and Linux.
        Nmap can be accessed by typing nmap into the terminal command line,
        followed by some of the "switches" (command arguments which tell a program to do different things)
        <br><br>
        syntax: nmap ip-range switches
        <br>eg: nmap 127.0.0.1 -Ss -sv -T5 -oN nmap.txt
        <br><br>
        We will discuss the main switches later in this blog.<br><br>
        <h4>Help Menu:  (-h)</h4>
        We can use the nmap help menu to find out more details about the usage of Nmap.
        <br> Syntax: nmap -h<br><br>
        
        <h3><u>Port Scanning </u></h3>
        <ul>
            <!--<li>-h :&nbsp; Help menu</li>
                This displays a help menu with nmap usage syntax and the list of switches you can use.
            -->
            The basic scan types are:
            <li>-sT :&nbsp; TCP Connect Scan</li>
            <li>-sS :&nbsp; Syn Scan/ Stealth scan </li>
            <li>-sU :&nbsp; UDP Scan</li>
            <li>-sC :&nbsp; Script Scan</li></ul>
            These are not the only scanning methods, but these are the main ones we regularly use.
            <br><br>
            <u>In <b>TCP Connect scan</b></u> (-sT), it follows the three way handshake method.
            It checks for open ports by performing the three-way handshake with each target port in turn.
            Nmap tries to connect to each specified TCP port, and determines whether the service is open by the response it receives.
            If Nmap sends a TCP request with the SYN flag set to a closed port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the RST (Reset) flag set.
             By this response, Nmap can establish that the port is closed. If the response is a SYN/ACK flag the port is open.Then a SYN packet is send to establish a connection
             between host and server.<br>
             Example : nmap -sT example.com
            <br>( You need to learn TCP handshakes for better understanding.)
            <br>
            <br>
            <u><b> Syn Scan</b> </u>(-sS) is also called a Stealth scan or Half-open scan.
             It is because, unlike a TCP Connect scan ,here the scan doesn't complete a three way handshake.
             Syn scan sends back a RST packet after receiving a SYN/ACK from server.This scan will be 
             much faster than TCP connect scan as it is not completing the three way handshake.
             It can be used to bypass older Intrusion Detection systems as they are looking out for a full three way handshake.
              This is often no longer the case with modern IDS solutions;
              it is for this reason that SYN scans are still frequently referred to as "stealth" scans.<br>
              Example : nmap -sS example.com
              <br><br>
              <u><b>UDP Scan </b></u>(-sU) ,as the name suggests scans for open UDP Ports.
              UDP connections are stateless, which means the server doesn't acknowledge the packet that is sent by the host.
              UDP connections are mainly used for video sharing and streaming purposes, because of its speed rather than quality.
              So it is harder t scan for open UDP ports. It takes more time to scan for open UDP Ports...(forever... :P)
              When a packet is sent to an open UDP port, there should be no response. When this happens, Nmap refers to the port as being " open|filtered ".
               In other words, it suspects that the port is open, but it could be firewalled.
               If it gets a UDP response (which is very unusual), then the port is marked as open.
               More commonly there is no response, 
              in which case the request is sent a second time as a double-check.
               If there is still no response then the port is marked " open|filtered " and Nmap moves on.<br>
               Example :  nmap -sU example.com
            <BR><br>
              <u><b>Script Scan</b></u>(-sC) performs a script scan using the default set of scripts. It is equivalent to --script=default.
              Some of the scripts in this default category are considered intrusive and should not be run against a target network without permission.
              <br>
              Example : nmap -sC example.com
              <br><br>



        <h3><u>Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)</u></h3>
        The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is an  addition to Nmap, extending its functionality .
         NSE Scripts are written in the Lua programming language,
         and can be used to do a variety of things from scanning for vulnerabilities, to automating exploits for them.
         The NSE scripts are used by a keyword " --script ".<br>To run a specific script, we would use:<br> --script=&lt;script-name&gt;
        <br>
        There are many categories available for NSE scripts, They are:
        <ul>
          <li>safe  : Doesn't affect the target</li>
          <li>intrusive : Most likely to affect the target, not safe to perform on live production enviornments</li>
          <li>vuln : Scan for vulnerabilities</li>
          <li>exploit : Attempt to exploit a vulnerability</li>
          <li>auth : Attempts to bypass authentication forrunning services</li>
          <li>brute : Attempt to bruteforce credentials for running services</li>
          <li>discovery : Attempt to query running services for further info about the network</li>
        </ul>
          A detailed view of NSE can be find on <a href="https://nmap.org/book/nse-usage.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Nmap Scripting Engine</a>
          <br><br>
          Usage of NSE scripts : <br> nmap --script smb-os-discovery --script-trace example.com <br>
          nmap --script snmp-sysdescr --script-args creds.snmp=admin example.com
          <br>nmap --script "default or safe" example.com
